# Wolfhound

This is the README for the www.wolfhound.ie repo. 

## How I made it?

I'd previously cobbled together several existing technologies into a custom repo as a CMS type solution, namely grunt, pug, AngularJS (now defunct). The idea was simple, create a small showcase site for my skills. 

Recently, I'd been looking at Static Site Generators which weren't around when I kicked this off, and I've recently rewritten, or am in the process of rewriting the site using Hugo & Tailwind CSS. 

## Why "open source it"?

i.e. Throw it up on github, and claim it is open source... I don't know. I'm effectively using github as a storage solution/CMS. I build and deploy from my local machine, but all the content is in git.
