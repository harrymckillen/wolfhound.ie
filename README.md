This is the README for the www.wolfhound.ie repo. 

## How I made it?

I use a good few of these technologies in work. I have previously always had a Wordpress-based site. I find myself just fighting with a theme to get it to do what I want. I also don't think I use Wordpress to it's fullest potentional. So I don't feel I need a CMS, as the content seldom changes. I rarely write blogs, despite several attempts at doing so. What this is, is a static site generator using:

* node.js
* gruntjs
* Sass
* Jade
* Javascript/AngularJS
* HTML... goes without saying really

## Why "open source it"?

i.e. Throw it up on github, and claim it is open source... I don't know. I'm effectively using github as a storage solution/CMS. I build and deploy from my local machine, but all the content is in git.
